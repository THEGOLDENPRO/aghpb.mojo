## Install
idk, this is fucking mojo. It hasn't even been released yet.

so read their docs and find out yourself if you're so nerdy: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/packages.html

## Examples
This is how you may retrieve a random anime girls holding programming books:
```mojo
from python import Python

from aghpb import Client

fn main() raises:
    let python = Python.import_module("builtins")

    let client = Client()
    let book = client.random()

    print(book.name)
    print(book.category)
    print(book.date_added)

    # We have to use python's file open function as mojo's variant is just not working correctly for me.
    let file = python.open("./anime_girl.png", "wb")
    _ = file.write(book.image_bytes)
    _ = file.close()

    # This is how we would have done it in mojo if it wasn't so bad rn.

    # var file = open("./anime_girl.png", "wb")
    # file.write(book.image_bytes)
    # file.close()
```
and yes categories don't fucking work because OF THIS DUMB.... ðŸ˜  *alright let's take a chill pill*
